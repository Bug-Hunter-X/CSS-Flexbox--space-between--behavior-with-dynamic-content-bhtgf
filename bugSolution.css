To address this issue, you can use a more flexible layout approach, such as centering the remaining item if only one exists:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

.item {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

/* Center a single item */
.container:has(:only-child) {
  justify-content: center;
}
```

This revised CSS uses `justify-content: center` to center the flex item, and `align-items: center` to center it along the vertical axis, as well.  The `:has(:only-child)` pseudo-class selector targets the container when it only contains one child element, ensuring proper centering of that single item. Alternatively, consider `justify-content: center` to always center the element, which is a simpler solution if centering is always the desired behavior regardless of the number of items.
